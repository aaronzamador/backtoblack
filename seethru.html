Restaurants are not making their safety standards and dining options clear, causing travelers who are high risk to avoid eating out. How might we provide all safety and dining information clearly so that high risk travelers will feel safe to dine out during the pandemic?</p></div>
        <div class="goal"><h4><b>The proposition</b></h4><p>See-Thru is an app to help health concerned travelers make informed eating decisions during the Covid19 pandemic. 

            See Thru takes the stress out of discovering local restaurants. Explore their menu, reviews and safety values all in one place.
            
            We follow up with recent diners to keep the information transparent, up to date, and real.</p></div>

            while eating out in a foreign place, and how their decisions could be made quicker and

        <div class="iaback"><h4><b>Information architecture analysis</b></h4><p>Our users made valid points–a lot of the content they were looking for didn’t seem to fit into one of the four navigation options offered, it was difficult to locate in long pages of text, and deciphering ED’s code took considerable time and effort. With this valuable feedback in mind, we made it our mission to break down why these were issues. We experimented with a card sorting exercise to visualize the Department’s current information architecture so that we could better grasp how we might improve it.<br><br>Viewing the website’s content this way brought a few key points to our attention.</p></div>
        <div class="iap1"><img src="images/ano.png"></div>
        <div class="iat1"><p><b class="subheaddetail">Some pages were hidden</b><br><br>Beyond the primary navigation, we found a hidden page–Top Tasks–filled with a collection of important links. It’s great for browsing, but many of the links can’t be found anywhere else on the site. We wondered if there was a way to integrate these useful links into the site’s main navigation.</p></div>
        <div class="iap2"><img src="images/pag.png"></div>
        <div class="iat2"><p><b class="subheaddetail">Page titles were indescriptive</b><br><br>Imagine you’re a parent to a child with disabilities searching for the legal rights that protect your child from discrimination, would you visit <i>Parental Rights</i> or <i>What are my Rights?</i> I’m betting parents spend a lot of time juggling that decision.</p></div>
        <div class="iap3"><img src="images/Frame 6seethru.png"></div>
        <div class="iat3"><p><b class="subheaddetail">Every page was link overload</b><br><br>In lieu of creating an adequate navigation, every page on the website is filled with links heading somewhere else. Why would a parent interested in student loans need a link to <i>Constitution Day</i>? It all just seems like a band-aid approach to avoid reconsidering their navigation.</p></div>
        <div class="iafin"><p>With these three points in mind, and what we had discovered from user testing, we created a new site map. The goal was to better group similar topics, reduce the amount of similarly named pages, and add new navigation for pages that didn’t seem to belong anywhere else.</p></div>

    <div class="finalback"><h4><b>My final thoughts</b></h4><p>Redesigning ED.gov was a passion project that I was personally invested in, as a previous user of their site. An important lesson I learned while taking on this challenge was the importance of a non-linear design flow. What shocked me about this project was how even to the last minute, users were still identifying ways it could be better. Allowing myself the freedom to iterate is how I was able to truly meet all of the user’s needs. What I finished with is something I truly think would create a quick and easy, informative trip to the Department’s website.
