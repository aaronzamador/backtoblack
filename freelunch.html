        <div class="casestudybackground"><h4><b>A little background</b></h4>
            <p>Free Lunch ATX is a small business based in Austin, Texas, focused on tackling food insecurity for the local unhoused community. They were created to help people experiencing homelessness find nourishing, healthy, and low-waste meals. They're fully funded by their Lunch Monitors–monthly supporters of their quarterly magazine.

        <div class="goal">
            <h4><b>The goal</b></h4>
            <p>Increase monthly supporters by redesigning the Free Lunch Website so that visitors can clearly understand Free Lunchs' mission and how to get involved. Eventually implement a supplementary app to quickly locate and access free meals for themselves or others struggling with food insecurity.<br><br>See the As-Is and To-Be below.

Our survey aimed to understand how the unhoused community were able to access food. </p></div>

            <div class="stext1"><p><b class="subheaddetail">Most participants were close to someone experiencing homelessness</b><br><br> 64% of our participants knew someone experiencing some form of homelessness, and 22% had experienced it themselves.</p></div>

            <div class="sfin"><p>These findings meant a Free Lunch redesign was more important than ever. The unhoused community relied on these services to survive, so it needed to be informative and usable.</p>

    <div id="compgrid">

        <div class="comback"><h4><b>Competitor analysis</b></h4><p>My teammates and I 
            decided to review two nonprofits–Mobile Loaves and Fishes and the Food is Free Project–who we considered direct competitors of Free Lunch, and two indirect competitors–Caritas and Meals on Wheels. 
            
        <br><br>Mobile Loaves and Fishes has been around for 21 years, and they offer not only food but clothing, hygiene and other life-sustaining items. As a religious nonprofit they alienate a fraction of their potential supporters. The Food is Free Project provides homeowners resources to help them start their own sustainable food garden. Anyone can participate–if you own a patch of land.<br><br>
        Caritas of Austin has a responsive website that gives a lot of donation options, but navigating the website is difficult due to the large number of resources they offer and poor information architecture. Meals on Wheels, like Mobile Loaves and Fishes is well established and offers a wide range of services, but their pages can be a bit dull and text heavy. Caritas and Meals on Wheels both cover a broad scope of services, which seems to water down their efficacy according to reviews left online.

           My teammates and I did an ideation exercise to identify possible pain relievers.<br><br>FL is ran by a group of Austin creatives–a film photographer, a musician, and an artist–so we not only wanted the website to have other donation options but also a shop that could sell these creatives’ projects and provide another source of income for FL.<br><br>We wanted to expand their reach and ease of access by creating a mobile app for their supporters that would allow users to send meals to others or reserve a meal they could go pick up at a FL location.

       We would be redesigning the Free Lunch website and designing a mobile app. My teammates and I drafted a user flow for both experiences and site map for the website. For the site map, we knew we needed to better organize the information so that users could clearly understand Free Lunchs' mission and how to get involved, so we added an "About" page. We also added an "Account" page for the user to access their online Zine.

After spending a lot of time considering the user's flow through our designs, we decided to split up to divide and conquer the two experiences. My two teammates decided to tackle the mobile app while I focused on the website.</p></div>

My website sketches focused on implementing these new features too, as well as adding the shop section and other methods of increasing engagement such as a newsletter subscription and donation goal tracker. We translated these sketches into lo-fi wireframes once we had discussed how we felt about the direction we were heading.</p></div>

Jazz offered ideas into what she thought would be realistic, like recipes for those looking to contribute immediately, and other resources they prefer to promote.<br><br>Luckily, our end goal hadn't changed–Redesign the Free Lunch experience so that users clearly understand their mission and goals, build a stronger connection between their website and other social medias, and eventually implement a supplementary app to quickly locate and access free meals (we're talking three to five years down the line).</p></div>

Instead, we made a few adjustments to our existing website wireframes and put them to the test.

Free Lunch had an amazing Instagram presence, but their personality wasn't coming through on their website. Their existing website had no photos of the staff, so I wanted to avoid using staff in photos, instead focusing on big food textures. I wanted an organic, poster style that I felt captured their 'local/film/creative' personality.<br><br>Below is a look at the final Hi-Fi screens.
