                                  For me, design has always been in the periphery of my vision, but it wasn’t until a summer in quarantine with a second-hand <i>Meggs' History of Graphic Design</i> that I understood how deeply rooted my passion was. After reading D. Norman’s <i>Design of Everyday Things</i> and <i>Emotional Design</i>, and an incredibly intriguing <i>The Meaning of Things</i>, by M. Csikszentmihalyi and E. Halton I felt a new calling I couldn’t deny, or resist.<br><br>
                      Luckily, the skills and views I’ve acquired from my past experience apply to UX design. 10 years working directly with customers–users–means their needs and frustrations are always my top priority. My experience working closely with business owners means I understand the importance of good design to increase productivity and profit. I believe in meshing functionality with beautiful design, because you can’t truly have one without the other.<br><br>
                      I’m still learning, growing, and soaking in knowledge–for me, the best feeling in the world is reaching the top of a steep learning curve.<br><br>

        <div class="casestudybackground"><h4><b>A little background</b></h4>
            <p>Free Lunch ATX is a small business based in Austin, Texas, focused on tackling food insecurity for the local unhoused community. They were created to help people experiencing homelessness find nourishing, healthy, and low-waste meals. They're fully funded by their Lunch Monitors–monthly supporters of their quarterly magazine. 
            </p></div>
        <div class="goal"><h4><b>The goal</b></h4><p>Redesign the Free Lunch experience so that visitors clearly understand Free Lunchs' mission and goals. Increase monthly supporters by creating a clearer brand, strengthening the connection between their current social media presence and their website visuals so that visitors will quickly identify their brand and feel that they are more credible. Eventually implement a supplementary app to quickly locate and access free meals for themselves or others struggling with food insecurity.<br><br>See the As-Is and To-Be below.

    <div id="research">   
        <div class="reviewback"><h4><b>Starting with a survey</b></h4><p>The Free Lunch mission is something my teammates and I really connected to, and we knew in order to get this right, we needed a really solid foundation. That's why we started our redesign with a survey that we sent to 30 participants. <br><br>Before finding their website, we discovered them through Instagram, so a major question we wanted to answer was about their current reach. How are people finding them? <i>Can</i> their audience find them? A misconception we wanted to test was that the unhoused community wouldn't have access to smart phones or the web, so our survey aimed to understand how the unhoused community were able to access food. </p></div>
        
            <div class="spic1"><img src="images/Group 13graphs.png"></div>
            <div class="stext1"><p><b class="subheaddetail">Most of our participants were close to someone experiencing homelessness</b><br><br> There are many forms of being unhoused–transitional, episodic, or chronic. 64% of our participants knew someone experiencing some form, and 22% had experienced it themselves.</p></div>
            <div class="spic2"><img src="images/Group 12graphs.png"></div>
            <div class="stext2"><p><b class="subheaddetail">The unhoused community count on people they know</b><br><br>Of the participants that had experienced homelessness personally, 100% had found access to food through their family, while 70% found access through friends. This means it's more important than ever to make those connections easier to access.</p></div>
            <div class="spic3"><img src="images/Group 14.png"></div>
            <div class="stext3"><p><b class="subheaddetail">Access to a smartphone is evident</b><br><br>90% of the participants that had experienced a form of homelessness had been able to access a smartphone. Similarly, 80% of participants who answered that they knew someone experiencing homelessness confirmed that that person was able to access a smartphone.</p></div>
            <div class="sfin"><p>These findings solidified for us that redesigning the Free Lunch experience was more important than ever. The unhoused community relied on these services to survive, so for us, this redesign was life or death.</p></div>
    </div>

    <div id="testinggrid">
        <div class="testingbackground"><h4><b>Usability testing</b></h4><p>Our initial review of the Free Lunch website gave us a few gut feelings, but we needed to know from real users what was working, and what wasn't.</p></div>
        <div class="uspic1"><img src="images/Group 4usability testing.png"></div>
        <div class="sdetails1"><ul>
            <li><b>Users didn't fully understand their mission.</li></b><br>
            <li><b>They struggled finding where to go to access free meals.</li></b><br>
            </ul></div><div class="sdetails2"><ul>
            <li><b>Users didn't understand why the only way to contribute was a recurring monthly donation.</li></b><br>
            <li><b>Users found the websites' current styling unorganized and hard to read.</li></b><br>
        </ul> </div></div>
        

        

    <div id="personagrid">
        <div class="personaback"><h4><b>User persona</b></h4><p>Based on the insights from our surveys and interviews, my teammates and I created an empathy map for our user. We wanted to jot down what our user was thinking and feeling to guide us into our user persona.</p></div>
        <div class="personaimage"><img src="images/Group 33userjourney.png"></div>
        <div class="personaback2"><p>Our user, Melissa Terry, is someone looking to help her community by donating her time and money. She has friends who are experiencing homelessness, so this cause hits close to home. She's health conscious and cares about sustainability.

    </div>   
    


    <div id="compgrid">

        <div class="comback"><h4><b>Competitor analysis</b></h4><p>Next, my teammates and I 
            decided to review two nonprofits–Mobile Loaves and Fishes and the Food is Free Project–who we considered direct competitors of Free Lunch, and two indirect competitors–Caritas and Meals on Wheels. 
            
        <br><br>Mobile Loaves and Fishes has many advantages considering they've been around for 21 years. They offer not only food but clothing, hygiene and other life-sustaining items. However, as a religious nonprofit they alienate a fraction of their potential supporters. The Food is Free Project provides homeowners many resources to help them start their own sustainable food garden. They're great because anyone can participate–if you own a patch of land.<br><br>
        Caritas of Austin has a very responsive website and gives very clear donation options, but navigating the website can be difficult due to the large number of resources they offer. Meals on Wheels, like Mobile Loaves and Fishes is well established and offers a wide range of services, but their pages can be a bit dull and text heavy. Caritas and Meals on Wheels both cover a broad scope of services, which seems to water down their efficacy according to reviews left online.

    <div id="ideation">
        <div class="iaback"><h4><b>Ideation and brainstorming</b></h4><p>
           With Melissa in mind, my teammates and I did an ideation exercise to identify possible pain relievers.<br><br>We knew that FL was ran by a group of Austin creatives–a film photographer, a musician, and an artist–so we not only wanted the website to have other donation options but also a shop feature that could sell these creatives’ projects and hopefully provide another source of income for FL.<br><br>We also wanted to expand their reach and ease of access by creating a mobile app for their supporters. We wanted to include features that would allow users to send meals to others or reserve a meal they could go pick up at a FL location.

    <div id="flowgrid">
        <div class="flowback"><h4><b>User flow and site map</b></h4><p>
       With the understanding that we would be redesigning the Free Lunch website and designing a mobile app for them, my teammates and I drafted a user flow for both experiences and site map for the website. For the site map, we knew we needed to better organize the information so that users could clearly understand Free Lunchs' mission and how to get involved, so we added an "About" page. We also added an "Account" page for the user to access their online Zine.

    <div id="journeygrid">
        <div class="jback"><h4><b>User journey</b></h4><p>
       We created a user journey for both the website and the mobile app as a way to visualize pains and opportunities our user would experience while navigating the application and site. </p></div>

        <div id="wireframes">
            <div class="wireback"><h4><b>Wireframes</b></h4><p>My teammates and I looked at the mobile app and the website redesign as a big opportunity for us to make Free Lunch more accessable to their audience and increase their funding. After spending a lot of time considering the user's flow through our designs, we decided to split up to divide and conquor the two experiences. My two teammates decided to tackle the mobile app while I focused on the website.</p></div>
            <div class="wireimg"><img src="images/Group 81freelunchsketches.png"></div>
            <div class="wireback2"><p>The mobile app sketches focused on the features we ideated–finding and reserving a nearby meal, sending a meal to someone in need, or reading the online Zine. My website sketches focused on implementing these new features too, as well as adding the shop section we imagined and other methods of increasing engagement such as a newsletter subscription and donation goal tracker. We translated these sketches into lo-fi wireframes once we had discussed how we felt about the direction we were heading.</p></div>

        <div id="stakeholderinterview">
            <div class="stakeback"><h4><b>Stakeholder interview</b></h4><p>We connected through email with Free Lunch Founder Jazz Mills early in our design project, but due to scheduling constraints we were not able to speak with her until the end of week two, after our research, ideating and sketches. We were excited to pick her brain and present her with some of our ideas. <br><br>What she told us threw a big wrench in our designs, because their operation is relatively small, and they prefer to stay focused rather than spreading themselves too thin.</p></div>
          
            <div class="stakequote"> 
                <p class="quotetext">"Our program isn't trying to solve homelessness in Austin – that's not realistic for us...We just want to tackle food insecurity at Camp Esperanza, and then at another camp and another.

                <div class="scopeback"><h4><b>Rescoping</b></h4><p>Speaking with Jazz Mills, the founder of Free Lunch, was an amazing opportunity for us and we were so happy she took the time to talk with us. She gave us a lot of insights into their day to day operations and goals, that we couldn't have known otherwise. For Free Lunch, many of our initial ideas were too ambitious, so we needed to reconsider how we planned on getting to our end goal. Jazz offered ideas into what she thought would be realistic, like recipes for those looking to contribute immediately, and other resources they prefer to promote.<br><br>Luckily, our end goal hadn't changed–Redesign the Free Lunch experience so that users clearly understand their mission and goals, build a stronger connection between their website and other social medias, and eventually implement a supplementary app to quickly locate and access free meals (we're talking three to five years down the line).</p></div>

        <div class="testingbackground2"><h4><b>Testing</b></h4><p>My teammates and I decided in order to align closer with Free Lunchs' current mission, we should put a hold on designing the mobile app. Instead, we decided to make a few adjustments to our existing website wireframes and put them to the test.

        <div class="t12"><p><b class="subheaddetail">Users quickly identified the Free Lunch mission</b><br><br>With clearer context of the way Free Lunch operated, users easily reported back to us their mission, hitting all three of the marks we were looking for–food insecurity, healthy, and sustainable.</p></div>

    <div id="hifi">
        <div class="styleb"><h4><b>Hi-Fi screens</b></h4><p>While the mobile app design was my teammates responsibility, the website style guide and hi-fi screens were mine. Free Lunch had an amazing Instagram presence, but I felt that their personality wasn't really coming through on their current website. I noticed their existing website had no photos of the staff doing work, so I wanted to keep that style consistent, instead focusing on big food textures. I wanted to implement an organic, poster looking style that I felt truly captured their 'local/film/creative' vibes.<br><br>Below is a look at the final Hi-Fi screens. While my teammates worked the mobile app, the website sketches, wireframes, and final visual designs were my responsibility and I'm happy with the way it turned out.

    <div class="finalback"><h4><b>My final thoughts</b></h4>
        <p>Redesigning Free Lunch was an amazing experience–Contributing to a cause I care deeply about and working with and for an incredibly inspiring founder and humanitarian. This began as a very open-ended project, and ended somewhere I could not have expected.<br><Br> The stakeholder interview with Jazz Mills meant a lot of the work for our mobile app was not totally feasable, it was great experience flexing our ideators and working directly with the founder to create something truly usable. What we learned about their operations made me appreciate Free Lunch even more.
