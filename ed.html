                                  For me, design has always been in the periphery of my vision, but it wasn’t until a summer in quarantine with a second-hand <i>Meggs' History of Graphic Design</i> that I understood how deeply rooted my passion was. After reading D. Norman’s <i>Design of Everyday Things</i> and <i>Emotional Design</i>, and an incredibly intriguing <i>The Meaning of Things</i>, by M. Csikszentmihalyi and E. Halton I felt a new calling I couldn’t deny, or resist.<br><br>
                      Luckily, the skills and views I’ve acquired from my past experience apply to UX design. 10 years working directly with customers–users–means their needs and frustrations are always my top priority. My experience working closely with business owners means I understand the importance of good design to increase productivity and profit. I believe in meshing functionality with beautiful design, because you can’t truly have one without the other.<br><br>
                      I’m still learning, growing, and soaking in knowledge–for me, the best feeling in the world is reaching the top of a steep learning curve.<br><br>

        <div class="casestudybackground"><h4><b>A little background</b></h4><p>If you’ve attended higher education in the United States, you’ve probably visited the U.S. Department of Education’s website. Their website is typically square one for many aspects of one’s learning journey, though users of the site range from students and parents, to educators, stakeholders, and officials. In fact, the Department boasted a staggering 15 million hits in 2019 alone. <br><br>To provide you with the foundational knowledge of the U.S. education system, the Department is equipped with a budget of $68 billion, and more than 4,400 employees. So then why, with a mission statement boasting student achievement and equal access for all, would their website fail to meet usability standards that were released seven years prior to their last large-scale update in 2015?<br><br>How can we improve our fellow citizen’s experience navigating this valuable resource so that they can easily take advantage of all the resources our nation has to offer?</p></div>
        <div class="goal"><h4><b>The goal</b></h4><p>Reimagine the way we expect visitors to find the information that they need.

    <div id="research">   
        <div class="reviewback"><h4><b>A heuristic review</b></h4><p>In order to understand how extensive a redesign was in order, giving the ED’s current site a complete heuristic review was our first task. What quickly became clear is that many aspects of the site–the navigation, layout, IA, accessibility, tone–all needed work. We came to this conclusion by defining a few major pain points that we saw early in our investigation.</p></div>
        <ul>
        <div class="reviewdetails1">
            <li><b>Several components are inconsistent depending on the page you’re viewing.</li></b><br>

        <div class="reviewdetails2"><ul>
            <li><b>Many color combinations are inaccessible by WCAG 2.0 guidelines.</li></b><br>
            <li><b>The Department fails to portray a clear voice or brand.</li></b>
        </div></ul>

    </div>

    <div id="testinggrid">
        <div class="testingbackground"><h4><b>Testing with users</b></h4><p>Our initial inspection of the Department’s website gave us a lot to think about, but we knew that testing the site with real users was the only way to get the insights that we needed to truly understand what was working, and what wasn’t. Creating a focused persona for a subsection of the many potential users helped us develop our testing plan.</p></div>
        <div class="testingimage"><img src="images/Frame 12.png"></div>
        <div class="moretestingb"><p>Parents make up 40% of the U.S. population in 2020,* so we chose to focus on their experience using ED’s site. We tested their ability to find and use basic functions of the website–the navigation, search bar, and contact information. Then, we took it a step further, testing their ability to locate and understand important details about federal aid–the different types of loans, their eligibility for aid, and scholarships that were currently available.<br><br>What we found may surprise you, but it’s exactly what we had feared.</p></div>
        <div class="t1"><p><b class="subheaddetail">Users preferred the search bar over the main navigation</b><br><br>The existing navigation is purposefully simple, and while it is useful at times, the majority of our users, when confronted with tasks that did not fit snuggly into one of the labels, decided to use the search bar. Adding insult to injury, the search bar offers no suggestions, and leads users to an overwhelming list of thousands of results.</p></div>
        <div class="tq1"><p>Find a scholarship? Is that a loan or a grant? I'm just gonna use the search bar.”</p><span class="testingquotesource">–User 2, a mother of two</div>
        <div class="t2"><p><b class="subheaddetail">Users revisited pages multiple times before finding what they were looking for</b><br><br>After using the search bar or primary navigation, users frequently came to the right page the first time, but they didn’t know it. A parent’s valuable time was quickly wasted while meticulously searching through text walls. Nail in the coffin? <b>The majority of our users blamed themselves.</b></p></div>
        <div class="tq2"><p>I can't believe it was here the whole time, I'm seriously blind!”</p><span class="testingquotesource">–User 1, a mother of two</div>
        <div class="t3"><p><b class="subheaddetail">Many users simply didn’t understand the content</b><br><br>When users did succeed in finding the right information, many found themselves feeling frustrated in their attempt to make sense of ED’s jargon. An overwhelming search bled into a time-consuming test of a user’s ability to even interpret the meaning of the words, blaming themselves yet again.</p></div>
        <div class="tq3"><p>Well, I kind of get it more after reading the second time.. Wait, let me read it again.”</p><span class="testingquotesource">–User 5, father of one</div>

    </div>   
    <div id="iagrid">
        <div class="iaback"><h4><b>Information architecture analysis</b></h4><p>Our users made valid points–a lot of the content they were looking for didn’t seem to fit into one of the four navigation options offered, it was difficult to locate in long pages of text, and deciphering ED’s code took considerable time and effort. With this valuable feedback in mind, we made it our mission to break down why these were issues. We experimented with a card sorting exercise to visualize the Department’s current information architecture so that we could better grasp how we might improve it.<br><br>Viewing the website’s content this way brought a few key points to our attention.</p></div>
        <div class="iap1"><img src="images/Group 43grayex.png"></div>
        <div class="iat1"><p><b class="subheaddetail">Some pages were hidden</b><br><br>Beyond the primary navigation, we found a hidden page–Top Tasks–filled with a collection of important links. It’s great for browsing, but many of the links can’t be found anywhere else on the site. We wondered if there was a way to integrate these useful links into the site’s main navigation.</p></div>
        <div class="iap2"><img src="images/Group 45grayex.png"></div>
        <div class="iat2"><p><b class="subheaddetail">Page titles were vague</b><br><br>Imagine you’re a parent to a child with disabilities searching for the legal rights that protect your child from discrimination, would you visit <i>Parental Rights</i> or <i>What are my Rights?</i> I’m betting parents spend a lot of time juggling that decision.</p></div>
        <div class="iap3"><img src="images/Group 46grayex.png"></div>
        <div class="iat3"><p><b class="subheaddetail">Every page was link overload</b><br><br>In lieu of creating an adequate navigation, every page on the website is filled with links heading somewhere else. Why would a parent interested in student loans need a link to <i>Constitution Day</i>? It all just seems like a band-aid approach to avoid reconsidering their navigation.</p></div>
        <div class="iafin"><p>With these three points in mind, and what we had discovered from user testing, we created a new site map. The goal was to better group similar topics, reduce the amount of similarly named pages, and add new navigation for pages that didn’t seem to belong anywhere else.</p></div>

With the IA carefully reconsidered, it was time to turn my focus to where it would live. My goal hadn’t changed, reimagine how visitors were expected to find what they need.

        <div class="wireback2"><p>My sketches revealed a clean, modular design for ED that I felt confident could address many problems that our team had uncovered. Digital wireframes came with more things to consider, and more ways to address our user’s needs. </p></div>

    <div id="testing">
        <div class="testingbackground2"><h4><b>Testing the wireframes</b></h4><p>I needed to be sure I was headed in the right direction, so I tested new users with the same original tasks, basic functions of the website and the user’s ability to locate and understand important details about aid. </p></div>
        <div class="t12"><p><b class="subheaddetail">Time per task was dramatically reduced.</b><br><br>Users still seemed to prefer using the search bar, however finding it not usable at this stage of the prototype, were still able to find what they needed without it relatively quickly.</p></div>

    <div id="lastfeaturegrid">
        <div class="lastfeature"><h4><b>One last feature</b></h4><p>I spent some time considering the last thoughts my users had left me with. Inspired by their frustration, and empowered by my modular design, I reimagined ED’s experience one last time.</p></div>

        <p>Redesigning ED.gov was a passion project that I was personally invested in, as a previous user of their site. An important lesson I learned while taking on this challenge was the importance of a non-linear design flow. What shocked me about this project was how even to the last minute, users were still identifying ways it could be better. Allowing myself the freedom to iterate is how I was able to truly meet all of the user’s needs. What I finished with is something I truly think would create a quick and easy, informative trip to the Department’s website.
